= springboot-kafka-websocket

The goal of this project is to implement two https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[`String Boot`] applications, `bitcoin-api` and `bitcoin-client`. The first simulates `BTC` price changes and the second, will listen from those changes and update an UI at real-time.

== Applications

* *bitcoin-api*
+
`Spring Boot` Web Java application service that simulates `BTC` price changes and pushes those changes to https://kafka.apache.org/[`Kafka`]

* *bitcoin-client*
+
`Spring Boot` Web Java application that was implemented using `Thymeleaf` as HTML template. It reads from `Kafka` and updates its UI using `Websocket`. It has also a chat where users can talk to each other, by sending comments publicly or privately.

== Prerequisites

* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[`Java 11+`]
* https://www.docker.com/[`Docker`]
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[`Docker-Compose`]

== Start Environment

* Open a terminal and inside `springboot-kafka-websocket` root folder run
+
[source]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

* Wait a little bit until all containers are Up (healthy). You can check their status running
+
[source]
----
docker-compose ps
----

== Running applications with Maven

Inside `springboot-kafka-websocket` root folder, run the following `Maven` commands in different terminals

* *bitcoin-api*
+
[source]
----
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects bitcoin-api -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=9081"
----

* *bitcoin-client*
+
[source]
----
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects bitcoin-client -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=9082"
----

The gif below shows two users checking real-time the `BTC` price changes. Besides, they are using a chat channel to
communicate with each other.
